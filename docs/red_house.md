# The Red House

The *red house* is the docker stack for services that wil be exposed to the internet.  That's why it's red, red for danger!

## Risks

We're going to set things up to be as secure as we can, but there are inherent risks with exposing things to the internet.  **Project: Blue House** offers no guarantees that you won't be hacked, but we will try our best to guide you on best practices.  Please make sure you have read the Security page before proceeding.
