## Installing

On your **laptop** use BalenaEtcher to write the proxmox iso file to a USB stick.

Once it's done put the USB stick in to your **host** , make sure it is connected to ethernet, keyboard, mouse and monitor and turn it on.  Access the BIOS of the **host** (usually by pressing DEL or f12).

Ensure that the options are selected to enable booting from USB, and that your USB stick is the primary boot device.  Save and exit BIOS.

The system boots from your USB stick and presents you with the installation menu...

PICTURE OF INSTALL MENU

'Install Proxmox VE' is already highlighted, press enter.

PICTURE OF EULA

Accept the EULA by pressing 'next' in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  (At this point I'm just going to apologise for the screenshots - in order to write this guide I plugged a spare computer in to my main TV and just took photos with my phone.  You'll also notice that the window doesn't quite fit the display and the buttons are disapearing of fthe bottom!  It should be good enough for you to get the gist, screenshots on other pages are actual proper screenshots from working instances)

The next page allows you to select which hard disk to install to.  Press next.

Start typing your country in to the top box and select yours when it is short-listed.  The system will best-guess your timezone and keyboard layout.  Correct these if neccessary and press next.

PICTURE OF REGIONALISATION

Add a reasonably strong password to the next page.  This will be your root password for your **grey-house** and will be the only line of defense for preventing people accessing your whole system so it wants to be secure, but also something you will not forget and can type relatively easily.  More on why we just use root on proxmox later.  Press next.

PICTURE OF PASSWORD

On the next page you configure the network.  The top box let's you choose your main network interfacce if you have more than one.  The second box is the name you choose for your **grey-house**, I've used 'greyhouse' and then add .local to the end (greyhouse.local).  The third one is the IP address you want your **grey-house** to have, pick one that's free on your network.  The fourth box is your netmask, if you don't know what this is 255.255.255.0 will probably do you.  The fifth box is the IP address of your gateway (usually your router).  And finally your DNS server, you can leave this at 127.0.0.1 for now.  Press next.

Quick double check of the summary for any glaring errors and press install.

After a while it will be installed and you'll press reboot.  As it reboots, catch it and go back in to your **host's** BIOS.  Disable boot from USB, and move the UEFI entry for proxmox to the primary boot device.  Save and exit.

You can now disconnect the keyboard, mouse and monitor from the **host**.  Wait a few minutes and access the Proxmox webUI from your laptop by typing your **grey-house's** ip address in to the address bar and adding port 800s (eg. http://10.0.0.99:8006 )


## Configuring

Type 'root' in to the username box and the password you set during installation in to the password box to login to your Proxmox webUI.  The first thing you'll see is a warning that you don't have an active subscription.  You should consider subscribing to one of the lower teir plans, but if you do not want to you can continue using proxmox for free.  Unfortunately without a minor modification the warning will appear every time you login, so lets use a script that removes it and keeps it removed.

INSTRUCTIONS...

This script will also ensure that we can download updates from the 'free' proxmox repositroy, which was not configured by default.

Now we'll make sure Proxmox is up to date, by pressing
