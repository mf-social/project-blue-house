# A Blue House extended

This page is ONLY for people using a single purpose install.  It explains how to add extra docker containers to your stack to enable external access or other services.  If you are not using a single purpose install you should create these services in separate VM's. (See Houses ->)

## Risks

We're going to set things up to be as secure as we can, but there are inherent risks with exposing things to the internet.  **Project: Blue House** offers no guarantees that you won't be hacked, but we will try our best to guide you on best practices.  Please make sure you have read the Security page before proceeding.
