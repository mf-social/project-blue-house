## Why does this repo exist?

## What is it for?

## No guarantees

## Terms you will see

This guide assumes a few things.  If the assumptions aren't quite right for your personal circumstances you can probably still use it with a few minor adjustments.  I've tried to make it obvious what 'devices' I'm talking about in each section by using certain terms in bold, that you could potentially interchange to suit your use case.

 - **Laptop** - This is the computer that you use everyday, that you're going to use to remotely configure things, that you're going to use to view websites and check services etc.  The software recomendations for **laptop** assume that it is running windows 10 at this time, but there are MAC/Linux equivelants and I may expand the instructions later to cater for these variants too.
 - **Mobile** - Your smart phone, your 'cell phone', the thing that trings when you're in trouble with your mum.
 - **Host** - This is the computer you will be turning in to your smart home / home lab.
 - **VM** - A virtual machine 
 - **<colour> house** - This is the names that are given to individual machines on the network.  More on the nomenclature later, but if you follow this guide all the way to the end and set up a Proxmox **host** with several VM's, you'll have a **grey house** (the **host** itself), a **blue house** (a **VM** running homeassistant - this is why the repo is called Project: Blue House!), a **red house** (a **VM** managing external access) etc.
